## Description

The Swoosh Room Finder is an android application that helps users navigate their way through the large Nike Headquarters campus in Beaverton, Oregon, specifically by helping the user to locate a specific room in the campus. 

There are 3 key features in this mobile app: 1) an interactive map, 2) a search function, and 3) a favorites page. The user can navigate through the campus and find information for a building through the interactive campus map, they can search for a room through the search function, and they can save locations to a Favorites page for future use. 

Currently the only two buildings that a user can click on are Mia Hamm and Tiger Woods Center. The floor plans used in this application are mock floor plans, not actual Nike floor plans.
